This is a vanilla folder/file setup for a Jekyll website that can be used as the starting point for any Jekyll website. This is specifically set up to work on GitHub Pages, but may work in other circumstances.

To use this project for a Jekyll website hosted on GitHub, clone or download this repository.  Move the contents of this repo into the gh-pages branch of your site’s repository. 

From the location of your repository, simply run ‘Jekyll Server’ in a command line prompt (while editing your gh-pages branch). You may then begin editing the templates to build the site you desire.
